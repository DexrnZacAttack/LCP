# Legacy Console Protocol
LCP is a wrapper library for java which contains all of Legacy Console Edition's packets (Excluding platform-specific packets).

## Progress
Currently the progress is rather dependent on the progress of [GRAnimated's LCE decomp](https://github.com/GRAnimated/MinecraftLCE), since the packets are constructed from the decompiled versions found there, as such, not all packets are currently implemented.
